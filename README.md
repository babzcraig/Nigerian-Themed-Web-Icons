# Nigerian-Themed-Web-Icons
A collection of Nigerian themed icons for use in visual designs Edit

The project is an attempt at telling our stories creatively through web icons. So much of our lives revolve around the web now, but it's hard to see representations of our lives on the web.

The project is open to anyone who wants to join in and lend their voice though visual expression.

Just design something, anything that's true to home and make a pull request.

Darisall!.

Feel free to hit me up anytime, if you have any questions.
